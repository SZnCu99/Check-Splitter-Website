# Check-Splitter-Website
A website for splitting the checks with your friends

This is my website created with MERN stack. That is, the frontend pages are written in React and the backend in node.js and
Express. I use mongoDB as my database and use package mongoose to manipulate the data objects in mongoDB database.

So far I've completed the login function and partially finished the new transaction record creating function. I'll continue 
to update the code and feel free to contact me if you find some bugs!
